littleengines is a HTML5 canvas-based drawing library that let's you add "engines" that, once tied together, will produce spyrographic-like drawings.

*Note that this lib will only work on Firefox for now as it uses [sets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)*
